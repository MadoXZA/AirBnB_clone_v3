irBnB Clone - RESTful API
Welcome to the fifth phase of the AirBnB clone project! In this phase, we'll be implementing a RESTful API for our AirBnB web application, allowing front-end clients and other services to interact with our data.

This project aims to replicate the backend structure and functionality of the AirBnB platform, specifically focusing on creating a robust API to interact with the data models such as Users, Places, Cities, Amenities, and Reviews
